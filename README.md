### RUN THE APP


### TEST THE APP
 


### THOUGHT PROCESS 


### TRADEOFFS?


### WHAT I'D LIKE TO IMPLEMENT WITH MORE TIME




Re-write of app in plain javascript because why not

Would normally put apikey in a git ignore file Wanted to re-write the app in vanilla javascript to focus on what I learned with the language

  - using ternary operators
  - focus on smaller functions, better variable descriptions, reuseability of code
  - maybe use bootstrap for styling and css transitions (learned at buildit)
  - sterize zipcode input
  - traverse the DOM
  - object destructuring galore
  
  More conscientious of UX: 
  - Add error handling 
  - Add loading animation Performance 
  - way to load api response faster??

Steps

Built out HTML structure
Added JS - Built out functionality
Add tests
Add Styling and Responsiveness
