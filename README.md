Weather App REMIX

Re-write of app in plain javascript because why not

<!-- how to run / build / test your creation.
your thought process when creating the solution.
any tradeoffs you made.
anything you might implement with more time (features, fixes, technical debt corrections etc). -->

Would normally put apikey in a git ignore file
Wanted to re-write the app in vanilla javascript to focus on what I learned with the language
 - using ternary operators
 - focus on smaller functions, better variable descriptions, reuseability of code
 - maybe use bootstrap for styling and css transitions (learned at buildit)
 - sterize zipcode input
 - traverse the DOM
 - object destructuring galore 

More conscientious of UX:
 Add error handling
 Add loading animation
 Performance - way to load api response faster??
